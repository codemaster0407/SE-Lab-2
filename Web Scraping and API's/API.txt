API (Application programming interface)
---------------------------------------

API gives access to data an dabstraction to the implementation.

Web based API 

We can't have all the data on a device. We use API's to gain access to lot of data using remote API's.

Representational state transfer (REST):
GraphQL ->look at this later. 

Client --------------> SERVER
Client sends request. Server receives the requests and it returns the webpage of the address given(URL)

GET Reqeust.
Response is given. 

API which follows REST are known as RESTFUL.

For RESTFUL,  the conditions are :
->Client - Server architecture
-> Statelesness
-> Layered System
-> Cacheability
-> Uniform design
-> Code on Demand

Program will send a request to the server. HTTP is used to send the request. 

A e book website home page will have different books list. Each book is a resource. Resource is an object. 

CRUD (Creating, Reading, updating ,deleting)
--------------------------------------------
We were just readin the data on the website by using get request for the data. Server responds and sends the data. 

JSON - JavaScript object notation.

Notations.

GET - READ 
POST - CREATE 

PUT - Update 
PATCH - Update
DELETE - DELETE
